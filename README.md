# chef-solo-search

Chef-solo-search is a cookbook library to add data bags and search powers
to chef-solo. Thanks for the initial idea and code goes to Brian Akins
[http://lists.opscode.com/sympa/arc/chef/2011-02/msg00000.html]()
Please see *Supported queries* for a list of query types which are supported.

## Requirements

    * ruby >= 1.8
    * ruby-chef >= 0.10
    
## Installation

In order to use this extension, create a (dummy-) cookbook and add a directory
called *libraries*. Next copy *libraries/search.rb* and *libraries/data_bags.rb*
to the newly created directory. Now you have to make sure chef-solo knows about
data bags, therefor add

    data_bag_path "<node_work_path>/data_bags"
    
to the config file of chef-solo (defaults to /etc/chef/solo.rb).

## Supported queries

The search methods supportes a basic sub-set of the lucene query language.
Sample supported queries are:
    
### General queries:
    
    search(:users, "*:*")
    search(:users)
    search(:users, nil)
        getting all items in ':users'
    search(:users, "username:*")
    search(:users, "username:[* TO *]")
        getting all items from ':users' which have a 'username' attribute
    search(:users, "(NOT username:*)")
    search(:users, "(NOT username:[* TO *])")
        getting all items from ':users' which don't have a 'username' attribute
            
### Queries on attributes with string values:
    
    search(:users, "username:speedy")
        getting all items from ':users' with username equals 'speedy'
    search(:users, "NOT username:speedy")
        getting all items from ':users' with username is unequal to 'speedy'
    search(:users, "username:spe*")
        getting all items which 'username'-value begins with 'spe'
            
### Queries on attributes with array values:
    
    search(:users, "children:tom")
        getting all items which 'children' attribute contains 'tom'
    search(:users, "children:t*")
        getting all items which have at least one element in 'children'
        which starts with 't'
            
### Queries on attributes with boolean values:
    
    search(:users, "married:true")
            
### Queries in attributes with integer values:
    
    search(:users, "age:35")
        
### OR conditions in queries:
    
    search(:users, "age:42 OR age:22")
        
### AND conditions in queries:
    
    search(:users, "married:true AND age:35")
        
### NOT condition in queries:
    
    search(:users, "children:tom NOT gender:female")
        
### More complex queries:
    
    search(:users, "children:tom NOT gender:female AND age:42")
    
### special case: 'chef_environment:_default'

Searching within the '_default' environment is also supported

    search(:users, "age:35 AND chef_environment:_default")

## Running tests

Running tests is as simple as:

    % ruby -Ilibraries tests/test_search.rb -v
