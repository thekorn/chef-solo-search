Supported queries
=================

The search methods supportes a basic sub-set of the lucene query language.
Sample supported queries are:
    
    General queries:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
        search(:users, "*:*")
        search(:users)
        search(:users, nil)
            getting all items in ':users'
        search(:users, "username:*")
        search(:users, "username:[* TO *]")
            getting all items from ':users' which have a 'username' attribute
        search(:users, "(NOT username:*)")
        search(:users, "(NOT username:[* TO *])")
            getting all items from ':users' which don't have a 'username' attribute
            
    Queries on attributes with string values:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
        search(:users, "username:speedy")
            getting all items from ':users' with username equals 'speedy'
        search(:users, "NOT username:speedy")
            getting all items from ':users' with username is unequal to 'speedy'
        search(:users, "username:spe*")
            getting all items which 'username'-value begins with 'spe'
            
    Queries on attributes with array values:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
        search(:users, "children:tom")
            getting all items which 'children' attribute contains 'tom'
        search(:users, "children:t*")
            getting all items which have at least one element in 'children'
            which starts with 't'
            
    Queries on attributes with boolean values:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
        search(:users, "married:true")
            
    Queries in attributes with integer values:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
        search(:users, "age:35")
        
    OR conditions in queries:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
        search(:users, "age:42 OR age:22")
        
    AND conditions in queries:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
        search(:users, "married:true AND age:35")
        
    NOT condition in queries:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
        search(:users, "children:tom NOT gender:female")
        
    More complex queries:
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
        search(:users, "children:tom NOT gender:female AND age:42")

Running tests
=============

Running tests is as simple as:
